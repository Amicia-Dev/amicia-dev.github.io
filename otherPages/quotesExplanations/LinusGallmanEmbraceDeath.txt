• Someone who has fully embraced death no longer fears dying, which gives them a unique sense of freedom. They live without the usual anxieties that weigh others down, moving through life with a calm acceptance of whatever comes their way. This can be unsettling to those around them, as they don’t seem to value life in the way most people do.

Despite this, they often seem happy—free from the worries that hold others back. They aren't necessarily suicidal, but they don’t fear death either; they simply exist without the same attachment to life’s usual constraints.
